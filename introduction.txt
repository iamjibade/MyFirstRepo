Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello! My name is Ajibade, and I am currently working through this course to deepen my skills in version control and software collaboration using Git and GitHub. I'm excited to apply these tools to my future projects.

My primary goal is to master the standard developer workflow, particularly using branches, pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts, as these are crucial for successful team environments. This hands-on experience is proving invaluable in building that foundational knowledge.
